""i'm not going to apologize for being the one to come out on top.""<br/>then one page later he fails a quiz and is trying to keep it on the DL because then pari will continue to ""keep her guard down"" and not try harder knowing it's possible to overtake him for the valedictorian spot. <br/>he's also judgy af towards amir (his later love interest) for no good reason. he thinks amir thinks he's better than everybody for some reason, even tho amir hasn't done anything except be antisocial at social gatherings. at one point he sees amir wearing a ravenclaw shirt and he's like ""he WOULD identify as ravenclaw, the most pretentious of the hogwarts hosues."" bitch??? a) literally what has he done to you??? and b) have you met yourself??? (btw: later amir says he thinks ariel's a gryffinclaw which is hilarious to me bc this man is definitely a slytherin. ((no shade to slytherins he does not speak for y'all.)) he's manipulative af and would literally do anything to be valedictorian. literally textbook slytherin with his level of ambitiousness and relentlessness.)<br/>anyway, ariel's only personality trait is being an annoying tryhard little bitch... and liking sour candy. he's sooooo quirky XD!1!!!<br/><br/>eh i don't feel like talking about this book anymore so lemme just jot down some last few thoughts.<br/><br/>there's a ridiculous number of harry potter references. like, way too many. there's also 1 mention of t*mblr and THE LITERAL PHRASE ""I SHIP IT"" in this book. i am in physical pain. what is this, 2012?<br/><br/>ariel ends up kind of realizing what he did was shitty (mostly bc all his friends started hating him for being a dick and only caring about himself/school) and realizes ~grades aren't everything~. but does that make up for the torture i endured for the other 80% of this book? no. the book is average at best in terms of plot/characters/interesting-ness. all the takeaways and lessons we're supposed to garner are pretty straightforward and the same as any other book with the similar premise. but the fact that ariel is super annoying makes it so much worse.<br/><br/>so does this book rly deserve 1 star? eh. it'd probably get a 2 if i was feeling generous, but i'm not. so fuck you.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

""ashley cackles with the fervor and depth that only a bitch blonde 16-year-old can"" (chpt 1 -- sorry no page numbers, i read it on ebook). -- not even subtle. yeah there's this whole thing ab how she's ""cool"" and a mean girl, aka she's girly, cares ab fashion and wears a lot of makeup, and is slutty. and apparently that means she's rumored to have slept with a teacher, something the main character brings up in her narration several times. like, ofc this is used to make ashley seem like a terrible person when we should rly be worried ab the fact that A TEACHER MIGHT BE SLEEPING WITH HER?? aka rape and pedophilia???? <br/>and this line... WHAT THE FUCK. for context, leila is worrying ab being outed, and she says this in her narration: ""she would just need to tell one person at school and the rumor would spread faster than ashley's legs in mr. harris's science lab"" (chpt 27). like,,, SERIOUSLY?!?!? even in a situation like this, where she's worried ab being outed, she needs to take shots at ashley?!?! like holy shit shut the fuck up man. you have bigger things to worry ab rn besides what ashley is doing with her legs. (not to mention, once again, she's more concerned ab ashley's rumored sluttiness than literal pedophilia.)<br/>also, there's this part that literally so stupid i can't even. she and another character show up to a dance wearing the same dress, and she ""runs out of the gym, crying hysterically."" like bruh. what???? is this satire? cuz who the fuck reacts like that what the fuck?<br/>- tomas, the epitome of the gay stereotype. does theater, ""is giddy to a stereotypical T"" (this is a real fucking line from the book btw), and gets befriended by the mean girls. ""he was a fun new accessory."" -- those are leila's words. and i feel like this whole situation says more ab leila than the mean girls, since they take him in and are friends with him. it's unclear whether it's bc they actually accept him or just want ""a fun new accessory"", like leila said, and tho it is slightly hinted at the latter, the mean girls' perspective is not something that's developed upon. could've made for more interesting nuance. but leila is super judgmental, saying, ""i was happy for him, but i resented the crap out of him"" [for being friends with the mean girls]. keep in mind, tomas came out and got bullied and called the f-slur. but the mean girls were nice to him. it's not rly leila's place to judge who tomas is friends with. and let's not forget leila herself isn't out. who's to say she wouldn't do the same thing if she was in tomas's positon?<br/>- leila's whole thing ab being #quirky and not like other girls. i understand the thing ab her not fitting in bc of her race and sexuality, but it's repeatedly emphasized how she doesn't know anything ab fashion and all that bullshit which is so tired, man. <br/><br/>cringy/weirdly immature moments:<br/>- ""the ball clocks me in the boobs."" bruh. why. <br/>- mc is auditioning for a play and is doing rly well. but ""any chance of that happening is gone as i fart loudly. in front of everyone.""

Mara, the main character, seemed pretty annoying and immature. once we got into the meat of the story, that that stopped being the case, for the most part. though i do think the voice is more immature than i expected. Mara is a senior in high school, but the voice reads more late middle school/early high school. there were some weird instances of ""teenspeak,"" which i found rather cringy, including ""craughing emoji"" (crying laughing emoji) and one of the characters saying ""no big,"" which apparently is short for ""no big deal."" like bruh. i hate when authors try to be #relatable by trying to emulate how teenagers talk. because they always do it badly.<br/>another concrete example of the immature voice is when the narrator (Mara) said ""the f-word"" instead of just ""fuck."" like...???? what is this, 3rd grade?<br/>and, going back to Mara acting immature, at the beginning of the book you find out Mara just broke up with her best friend/girlfriend, Charlie. and for some reason she doesn't get why Charlie would be ignoring her texts. then, at this party, Mara sees Charlie with another girl and gets upsetti spaghetti. then afterwards, she finds out that one of her other friends, Hannah, was attacked and Charlie and that other girl helped her. but Mara isn't bothered by the fact that her friend was attacked, she's bothered by the fact that that girl was there with to help Hannah and not her. like bruh. BRUH. (also, i was expecting for Mara to get to actually talk to the girl and the reader gets to find out more about her, but no. she's basically just used as a plot device to make Mara jealous and upset.)<br/>there was also this ""fake nice""/""faux sweet"" mean girl thing going on with one of the other characters, which i thought was really stupid and pissed me the hell off every time i saw the word ""saccharinely."" of course they become friendly at the end, but that felt really stupid and unnecessary to me. i hate that fake-sweet bullshit.<br/><br/>okay, now onto the stuff i liked. this is a book about sexual assault, and i think it was handled very well. this part of the story was very well done. the nuances in the situation, the difficult choices, how different people might act differently. it was very raw and heart-wrenching. there's one scene with between Alex and Mara that i absolutely loved. juxtaposed and in direct opposition to Owen, it was cathartic.<br/><br/>so, if you want to read a book that talks about sexual assault and does it well, this book definitely does that. but the fact that you have to shovel thru some more annoying stuff to get to it kinda sucks. but i think the latter half of the book over-balances the annoying-ness of the earlier chapters, thus why i'm giving it 4 stars rather than the 3.5 i was tempted to give bc of the first 20-30%.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Cho only included what she needed for the sake of telling the story, but i feel like it could've been more complex and interesting if there was more. it would've done better for the worldbuilding too. it just feels weird to me that of all things, only gumiho and goblins were mentioned? it's kind of a weird combination. it would've made more sense if it were just gumiho or a bunch of mythical creatures existed.<br/>i liked that Miyoung's problems with her mother was a big contributor to her difficulties in making connections with other ppl, and seeing her work through that. but in the end her mother never being affectionate to her and being literally abusive was brushed off as ""everything she does is for you"" and that her mother really did love her all along. meanwhile, her mother being cold and withholding important information from her was kind of what caused all their problems to begin with.<br/><br/>so, tldr, this book was interesting and pretty enjoyable and jihoon is my fave, but the story is not as deep as i would've liked.

UP. I kinda wish I hadn't read it.... It is terrifying because it talks of horrible things that have and do happen to real women who go missing and the effect it has on their families. This book's biggest strength is how it portrayed the effects of such a tragedy on the victim's family; how they try to cope or change because of it.<br/>When secrets are discovered and the truth starts to unravel, the book becomes pretty addictive, as you want to find out more. The only hindrance to the reader are the occasional passages graphic detail -- this definitely slowed me down because I was worried about what I was going to have to read next.<br/>This story is pretty complex and it takes you on twists and turns, but I applaud Slaughter's execution in how she reveals important details and leaves no loose ends.<br/><br/>As for things that made me dislike the book, Claire, the main protagonist, is quite annoying. She's selfish and inconsiderate of others, and constantly puts her loved ones in danger because she doesn't want to handle things herself. And even after she finds out she can't trust someone, she still finds herself believing what they say as if they're not CLEARLY full of shit.<br/>The vibe in the background is that ""rich white suburban housewife"" bullshit where the other women (besides the main protagonists, of course....) are bitchy and gossip-y and the main character(s) don't like them. Wow, we love women who hate other women for basic, two-dimensional reasons.<br/>Also... there were a couple random instances of racism just casually thrown in there. I would say that it's to show the Claire might be ""subconsciously"" racist, since it's supposed to be her perspective, but it was never an overt and important character trait of hers, so... idk. Here are the two instances I noted:<br/>- ""her only regret about their sex life was that she couldn't do it wearing a burqa"" (ok, this wasn't about claire, but another protag, but still.... what the fuck?)<br/>- ""was it racist to assume that rich white people were only robbed by black or Hispanic gang members?"" (YES. OBVIOUSLY YES.)<br/><br/>All in all, this book is well-written and well-done, but Claire's kinda stupid and we don't stan racism.<br/><br/>If you're interested in reading a book with a similar concept (thriller about a sister searching for her missing sister) but not as hardcore, I highly recommend Sadie by Courtney Summers! It is not graphic at all (but CW for mentions of pedophilia) and is YA, so it may be more comfortable for those who aren't ready for something this intense. (Also I like Sadie better anyway so....)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Truthfully, I enjoy the book enough while I'm reading to not notice it, but afterwards I realize the entire near 500-page book can be summarized in a couple sentences. What's all that extra fluff? I'm not sure, tbh.<br/>This didn't really affect my enjoyment of the book, which is why I still gave it the rating I did, but it's something others have pointed out that I noticed too.<br/>There were some interesting discussions about superheroes that I liked, which kind of take into consideration the effects superheroes would have if they existed in real life -- normal people become too dependent on heroes doing all the work saving people, so they stop trying to do that themselves.

They had a great relationship and Appa gave me mad Asian dad feels.<br/>Disliked: Desi's actions. She's crazy-manipulative to Luca trying to get them into K-Dramatic situations together to try to get him to like her (even though he already clearly likes her, something that her friends pointed out to her) and is even analyzes her manipulative-ness at one point when Luca complains about his ex being manipulative... but she makes the excuse to herself that what she's doing is different... At one point, as the K-Drama Steps describe, she must ""make the ultimate sacrifice to prove her love."" Risking your future for your high school boyfriend? Definitely a great idea.

I feel like with the way it started, there was a lot of potential for Cath to grow as a character, but none of that happened. There wasn't really even a plot. Nothing of significance happened. And there wasn't really an ending either. I found it unclear whether Cath actually finished Carry On, which I feel like was her one true goal this entire book. Also, the little excerpts of Simon Snow are really confusing, since we don't know the actually plot of the story. (And it's clearly a Harry Potter rip-off, I died inside when the actors were described to have hair that was ""longer than usual"" in the fourth movie.) So, all in all, the book just felt very incomplete and half-baked, and I'm honestly very annoyed with the fact that the book started out decent but turned out to be a huge disappointment.
